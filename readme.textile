h1. Optical flow based face anonymization in video sequences

In this paper we present a method of anonymization of people’s faces in video. Results are analyzed on the basis of optical flow methods. Anonymization bases on face detection. Because of mistakes made by such detectors in video sequences, gaps and false detections appear. They are recognized using the results of face detections and optical flow analysis. In this paper we describe: face detectors and the results of method of analysis of optical-flow based detector. We present novel method of filing gaps and false detection recognizing with use of optical flow. Then we present visual results.
